### Abstract

Reducing nutrient runoff and flooding is a high priority for many communities and a challenge that requires cooperation from many different stakeholders who often have conflicting interests or priorities.
Nature-based infrastructure such as instituting stream buffers, wetland restoration and water retention strategies all decrease flooding and nutrient runoff. However, deciding where these land-use changes would:
1. have the greatest impact on flooding and nutrient runoff and
2. are most amenable to stakeholders can make these changes difficult to implement.
In this study, we present a workflow for exploring targeted nature-based solutions for capturing and mitigating
runoff along those pathways. This tool could enable multi-stakeholder exploration of different strategies for runoff
mitigation.
